# TikTok Video Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify TikTok videos based on whether they contain claims or opinions. The project is part of a full cycle machine learning pipeline, involving data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
*This is a requirement final project to complete the Google Advanced Data analytics project.

## Objective
To develop a predictive model that helps TikTok prioritize reported content more efficiently by classifying user-submitted videos as either "claim" or "opinion."

## Key Steps:
### 1. Data Understanding
Gather insights from TikTokâ€™s video dataset. Identify missing data, inspect data types, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key metrics (e.g., claim vs opinion counts).
- Identify data inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for further analysis.
- Use both Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) and Tableau for data visualizations.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Conduct hypothesis testing to understand relationships between verified/unverified users and their content type.
- Summarize findings in an executive report.

### 4. Model Building
- **Logistic Regression**: Predict user verification status based on video characteristics.
- **Random Forest**: Build a final classification model to distinguish claims from opinions in user-submitted videos.

### 5. Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy and key metrics.
- Create an executive summary, highlighting the model's effectiveness and insights.

### 6. Visualization
Present the results in a clear, understandable format using Tableau dashboards for stakeholders.
